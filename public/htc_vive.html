## Motion controller support

Support for the [Vive wireless motion controllers](https://www.vive.com/us/support/faqs/#Controllers) is [currently unavailable](https://iswebvrready.org/#gamepad-extensions) in the latest Firefox Nightly builds. You can follow the platform progress of the Firefox implementation of the [Gamepad API (Extensions)](https://w3c.github.io/gamepad/extensions.html) [here on IsWebVRReady.org](https://iswebvrready.org/#gamepad-extensions) (and, in particular, [this tracking bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1299926)). Stay tuned!


## VIVE Pre development kit

If you have a [Vive Pre development kit](https://developer.viveport.com/managed-assets/shared/desktop/vive/Vive_PRE_User_Guide.pdf), you may still be able to follow these same instructions to use WebVR, but there are no guarantees of stability nor performance. (It's worth noting that there are mostly only the modifications made between the Vive Pre and Vive consumer version are mostly slight changes to the aesthetics and comfort [e.g., the most obvious being the IPD adjustment knob and slight headstrap adjustments].)
