## Overview

### What is WebVR?

WebVR is an experimental JavaScript API that provides access to Virtual Reality devices, such as the [Oculus Rift](https://www3.oculus.com/rift/), [HTC Vive](https://www.vive.com/), [Samsung Gear VR](http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-vr/), in your browser.

* [Way to Go](/directory/showcase/way-to-go)
* [BB8](/directory/showcase/bb8)


## Getting started

Read the [overview](/) to learn about WebVR.

To view WebVR content, you will need a compatible browser and VR headset.

* [Compatible headsets](https://dash.readme.io/project/webvr/v1.0/docs/supported-vr-systems)
* [Browser setup instructions.](https://dash.readme.io/project/webvr/v1.0/docs/downloads)
* [See browser support](iswebvrready.org)

You can also view WebVR content on IOS or Android phones using browsers that do not support WebVR through the [WebVR polyfill](https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill) and using a  [Google Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/) viewer.

## Contributing

We'd love your help!

WebVR is currently being developed as an open standard by a [W3C Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webvr/) that includes representatives from most major browsers. The [WebVR community](/community/) is a friendly open-source community that welcomes all forms of contributions! There's a ton of ways to participate -- in [development](/contributing/#development), [testing](/contributing/#testing), [translation](/contributing/#translation), [documentation](/contributing/#documentation), [blog posts](/contributing/#blog-posts), [tutorials](/contributing/#tutorials), and [translation](/contributing/#translation). Here's just a small sampling of ways you can get started:

* Contribute content on the WebVR Rocks site in the form of [documentation](/contributing/#documentation), [blog posts](/contributing/#blog-posts), and [tutorials](/contributing/#tutorials).
* [Translate](/contributing/#translation) the text of the [specification](https://w3c.github.io/webvr/) or pages of this site into another language.
* [Submit a WebVR site](/directory/submit/) to the [WebVR Directory](/directory).
* [Test WebVR sites](/contributing/#testing) listed in the [WebVR Directory](/directory) for functionality, compatibility, and comfort.
* And here's our [roadmap](/roadmap/), so you can see where we're headed in the next year.


## Tutorials and Articles

### Lovingly authored by WebVR Rocks

The whole Slack team is pitching in and writing guides to working with the Slack platform and its emergent ecosystem. [Contact us]() if you'd like us to feature your tutorial here.

### Guides and articles from across the web

### Issue or suggestion for the WebVR API?

If you would like to report an issue or suggest a change to the [WebVR API](/api) [specification](https://w3c.github.io/webvr/), first check the [open issues](https://github.com/w3c/webvr/issues), and if the issue does not appear to be reported, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/w3c/webvr/issues/new).

### Need help with the WebVR Rocks site?

You've come to the right place! Send a message to the WebVR Rocks Support staff using the form here.

### Found an issue with a WebVR site in the wild?

As the [WebVR API](/api) is still in flux, you can expect some issues with WebVR sites in the wild. If you encounter issues with a WebVR site and the site in question is listed in the [WebVR Directory](/directory) has a link to the project's source code (e.g., a GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab repository), try first reaching out to the project maintainers (check the project's `README`, and, if possible, file an issue where appropriate). Otherwise, you can file an issue using the form here to report any compatibility or stability issues you encounter. The WebVR Compatibility volunteer team will try its best to diagnose the issue and reach out to the developer, if possible, to attempt to address the issues with a patch to fix the issue.

### What should I include in my support request?

Provide us with as much essential information as possible. And include any screenshots (e.g., of the page and any relevant errors or warnings in the Developer Console in [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Opening_the_Web_Console) or [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/)), video captures, or links that are related to your problem, question, or suggestion. If you would like us to try to respond to you, please also provide your email address and/or Twitter account name.
