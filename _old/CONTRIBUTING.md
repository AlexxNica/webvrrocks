# Contributing to WebVR Rocks

WebVR Rocks welcomes contribution from everyone. Here are the guidelines if you are
thinking of helping us:


## Contributions

Contributions to WebVR Rocks or its dependencies should be made in the form of
GitHub pull requests. Each pull request will be reviewed by a core contributor
(someone with permission to land patches) and either landed in the main tree
or given feedback for changes that would be required. All contributions should
follow this format, even those from core contributors.

Should you wish to work on an issue, please claim it first by commenting on
the GitHub issue that you want to work on it. This is to prevent duplicated
efforts from contributors on the same issue.

Head over to [WebVR Rocks Starters](https://webvr.rocks/contributing/starters)
to find good tasks to start with. If you come across words or jargon that do
not make sense, please check [rocks](/rocks/glossary) first. If there's no
matching entry, please make a pull request to add one with the content `TODO`
so we can correct that!

See the [`README.md`](README.md) for more information on how to start working
on the WebVR Rocks site.


## Pull-request checklist

- Branch from the `master` branch, and rebase (if needed) to the current
  `master` branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge
  cleanly with `master`, you may be asked to rebase your changes.
- Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is
  correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).
- If your patch is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review
  it, you can @-reply a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a
  comment, or you can ask for a review in `#WebVR Rocks` on `irc.mozilla.org`.
- Add tests, if possible, for your changes.


## Conduct

In all WebVR Rocks-related forums, we follow [this Code of Conduct](https://webvr.rocks/contributing/code-of-conduct). For escalation or moderation issues, please contact Chris Van Wiemeersch (hearcomestreble@gmail.com) and Casey Yee (caseyyee.ca@gmail.com).
